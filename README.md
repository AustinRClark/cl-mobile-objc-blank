# Objective-C Blank Object

`NSObject` is the grandfather to just about every object we will encounter while building our iOS apps. We'll also be making plenty of our objects on top of `NSObject`. The proper term for this is creating "subclasses" of NSObject.

Create a new sublcass of `NSObject` called `Blank`. Once you add the file to your project, import `Blank.h` in to your `main.m` file. Finally, allocate and initialize a new instance of your Blank object with the variable name `myBlankObject`.
